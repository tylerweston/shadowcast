# spectro
Build walls and use lights to activate all the detectors. When a detector is being hit by the correct color of light, it will become solid.  
Save your progress by choosing save from the the top menu (It will also autosave at the start of each level), and you can continue your game by choosing continue from the main menu. There are three difficulty levels available from the options menu, each with their own saved level and high score.  
You can toggle the wiggly, hand-drawn floor effect in the options menu if you don't like it.

## how to play
There are red, green, and blue lights in each level, along a number of detectors. The detectors are the double spinning arcs. The object is to make sure the center of each detector is the color indicated. You can click on the grid to build walls to block lights, or you can drag the lights around to put them in other places. Lights cannot be dragged across gaps in the floor (OK, if you move your mouse fast enough, you can drag them across the gaps, but that's on the fix list). Every level is guaranteed to be solvable, so if you are ever super stumped, you can choose "give up" from the top menu to see the solution to the puzzle!

## keyboard contols
R: activate red light  
G: activate green light  
B: activate blue light  
Space: Go to next level when all detectors are active
